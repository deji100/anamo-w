        p1: "The one constant in Cybersecurity is the need for deep forensic data collection. Sadly, most cybersecurity products gravely lack an ability to identify, collect, or understand the significance of such data collection. An example of “struggling” can be found with those who have enabled logging within their systems but ignore the vast quantities of alert notifications, likening them to white noise. Anamo solves this dilemma by allowing for customization as several levels… but more importantly, Anamo understand exactly what Forensic Information is essential to enable the InfoSec Team to pinpoint an exact event, transaction, date, time, by device, etc.",
        p2: "One example of essential forensic data collection that Anamo excels in would be the attributes of Users and Groups Permissions.",
        p3: "First, Anamo automatically gathers all associations of users and groups permissions regardless of what Operation System (OS) that they use (Windows or Linux). Anamo then automatically present both OS’s permission in their native format (numeric or symbolic) and allows the InfoSec administrator several options to interrogate such as hosts, path, etc.",
        p4: "Anamo goes further than that and tracks even the most subtle permission changes and offers the Admin their choice of how quickly such an event would generate an alarm. In short, Anamo autonomously gathers the data and delivers deep forensic tracking to the Admins and displays both Data and Alerts logically for remediation and investigative purposes.",

Anamo understands what the purpose of Logs are, but rather than collecting them (which is always a good idea), Anamo interprets the meaning, actions, and behavior of the User (or Group) to essentially monitor, notify, and alert Admins to the actions of a Technical-Adversary (Authorized or not) who might be categorized as a suspicious or bad actor. Today, that problem is solved through the ingenious and tastefully presented user interface that does not require a computer science degree to immediately gain the gist and detail that has been woven into the Anamo fabric.",

        p1: "Anamo is continuous diagnostics and mitigation, it delivers “always-on” vulnerability assessment scanning and no competitor can scan as often or as deeply as Anamo. There are many types of “external scanners”, but they are not behind the firewall and limited to the type of data that the scanner can collect, this limitation leaves the customer with (potentially) knowing the problem but without the essential ability to receive remediation validation in real-time. VM (Virtual-Machine) based Nodes are also able to scan for CVE’s and are able to evaluate a client vulnerability risk posture more rapidly than external scanners; however, they all remain limited in their ability to gather critical and essential data for decision-makers in real-time. VM’s do not reside within the Host and therefore cannot gather the same deep-seeded OS Level information that the Anamo Agent continuously gathers 24/7/365.",
        p2: "Easily identifiable differentiators: Scanners cannot see beyond a named software and have zero insight into the packages that make up the software. VM’s – posing as internal scanning node are not agent-based, an extremely limited purview into a devices operating system, but they can reach limited information from more devices without an Agent. The Anamo Agent sits directly upon the protected system and is intimately knowledgeable with nearly every single attribute and possible attack vector far beyond software and all the way down to a user, their permissions, and subsequent behavioral modifications.",
